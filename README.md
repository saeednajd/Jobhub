Jobhub is an open-source project designed to help job seekers and employers connect more effectively. The platform provides a centralized hub for job postings, applicant tracking, and communication between the two parties. This README file will guide you through the key features and usage of the Jobhub project.

****Key Features****
1. **Job Posting**: Employers can easily post job openings, including detailed job descriptions, required qualifications, and application instructions.

****Database Configuration****
Jobhub uses SQLite as the database for storing job postings, user profiles, and other application data. To configure the database settings, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project directory and rename it to `.env`.
2. Open the `.env` file and find the following lines:
```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database.sqlite
```
3. Update the `DB_DATABASE` variable to the desired file path and name for your SQLite database file. For example:
```
DB_DATABASE=/path/to/your/database/jobhub.sqlite
```
4. Save the `.env` file and make sure the specified directory for the SQLite database file exists and is writable by the application.
